These screencasts show the installation of coral from the very beginning of installing the OS.  I am using the CentOS 5.5 installation DVD.

Some notes:
Throughout this process, I continuously use the insecure password of 'monkey'
just for demonstrative purposes.  One would want to change that for a live
server (obviously).

In the second screencast, I use wget to grab some installation files from 
my own personal webspace.  Though, I don't mind if others grab these too,
it might go against the licensing terms for some of the software so probably
better to just download from the source.  

The VirtualBox image for this install is located at:
